# SVVST Website - Documentation
Welcome to the documentation for the Shri Veda Vyasa Seva Trust (SVVST) website. This readme/documentation collects implementation details, how to run and build the project, and notes for making changes without confusion
- For live demo, check https://www.shrivedavyasatrust.in/

## Project overview
- This is a small static website built with React + Vite to showcase SVVST (Shri Veda Vyasa Seva Trust), Cherthala. The project uses modular React components (JSX files under `src/`) and lightweight CSS for styling
- The initial version of this site was developed on 15 June 2025
- A single `index.css` (under `src/styles/`) is used for global styling; components are separated into individual JSX files for clarity and future extension
- React was chosen to make future full-stack integration easier if/when required
- Fonts used: Oswald, Inter, Titillium Web (Google Fonts linked in `index.html`)
- Theme colors: `#F27A1A`, `#161718`, `#1E2125`
- Layout targets desktop by default; media queries are present to improve mobile/tablet responsiveness
- Icons: `react-icons`
- Images: optimized formats (AVIF/WEBP) for efficiency

## Tech stack
- Vite (dev server + build)
- React (JSX)
- GSAP (for SplitText animation)
- React Icons

## Scripts (from `package.json`)
- The `package.json` in this project exposes the following npm scripts:
  ```powershell
  npm run dev      #starts Vite dev server
  npm run build    #builds production files into /dist
  npm run preview  #preview the built site locally
  ```
- Run these commands from the project root (where `package.json` is)

## Local development
Requirements:
- Node.js (recommend LTS 18+) and npm installed
- Quickstart (Windows PowerShell):
  ```powershell
  npm install #to install dependencies
  npm run dev #start dev server
  ```
- Open the dev server URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) and edit files under `src/` - hot module replacement (HMR) will update the browser

## Build & preview
- To produce production assets:
  ```powershell
  npm run build #This produces a `dist/` folder containing static files ready to be hosted 
  ```
- You can preview the production build locally with:
  ```powershell
  npm run preview
  ```

## Before hosting
- Change base to the repo name if hosting on GitHub Pages
  ```js
  import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
  import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

  // https://vite.dev/config/
  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [react()],
    server: {
      host: true,
    },
    base: '/your-repo-name/',
  })
  ```

## Project structure (key files & folders)
Top-level (important files):
- `index.html` - base HTML template, fonts linked here
- `package.json` - scripts and dependencies
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration (edit `base` for GH Pages if needed)
- `README.md` - this file

`src/` (React app source):
- `main.jsx` - app entry
- `App.jsx` - main layout and routing
- `Hero.jsx`, `Events.jsx`, `Founders.jsx`, `ContactUs.jsx`, `MissionVisionValues.jsx`, `SplitText.jsx` - component files
- `styles/index.css` - global styles
- `assets/` - images, `event_data.json`, and subfolders (event images, founders images). Keep images in `assets/`
- Notes: Keep the `assets/event-images` naming consistent with how `event_data.json` references images. The components expect images to follow the existing naming conventions

## Section-specific notes
### Hero section
- The hero contains scrolling background images. To add a new image:
  1. Add the image file under `src/assets/`
  2. Import it in `Hero.jsx` or where backgrounds are defined
  3. Add the imported image to the `backgrounds` array used for the scrolling animation
- The main heading animation uses `SplitText` from GSAP

### Events section
- To add a new event:
  1. Add the required event metadata to `src/assets/event_data.json` following the existing format
  2. Place the event images in `src/assets/event-images/` and import or map them consistently in the code
  3. Ensure image filenames follow the same naming convention as existing entries so the `imageMap` lookup works correctly
- Example JSON event entry:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Vriddhi 2025",
    "date": "23-25 May 2025",
    "time": "9 AM - 5 PM",
    "term": "3 days",
    "description": "An interactive guidance program for children with fun games, activities, including meals",
    "thumbnail_img": "./event1_thumbnail.webp",
    "images": ["./event1_1.png", "./event1_2.png"],
    "galleryLink": "./"
  }
  ```

## Assets & images
- Images are stored under `src/assets/` and optimized (AVIF/WEBP)
- Keep using efficient formats when adding assets
